I've felt frustrated by the fact that I don't am in full control over Git and GitHub. So I clearly needed to do something about it. 
When i tried a course at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> i thought it was good to get a jump start. Now they had a Black Friday offer, so I thought, what the heck and I bought a subscription.
Here are <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/ebe250899fb5eca290d7442183754c25/">my earned Git badges</a> until now. I'm planning on going through the rest of the courses as well.

I wasn't fully satisfied with writing markdown pages in the repository as a solution for the blog we're supposed to do. A wordpress blog would have been the easy solution, but why stay in the comfort zone...
So i decided to have a go with Github pages. Initially i tried to get Octpress a go, but after some merging problems and other troubles, I gave up and tried Jekyll instead.
