About my backpack regarding webiness. I started out with web development in 1998 with html, sql and classic ASP. I've done a lot of things working in the IT business along the way. I've been working as IT Technician (administering clients, servers and networks), IT security consultant and developer. Now I've decided to go for web development and SQL, because that's what I really love doing. 

My hopes and goals is to get a deep dive in JavaScript and improve my skills a lot.
