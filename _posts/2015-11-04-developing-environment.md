I didn't write anything about the developing environment that I was planning to use in the former blogpost, because I hadn't decided which one to use then. I've decided to go for JetBrains WebStorm. The license is free for students and all you need is a valid student e-mail address. More information could be found here: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">https://www.jetbrains.com/student/</a>

I'm dreaming of a nice, fancy blog, but then I realize I have to prioritize my time. I could spend a lot of time to setting up a blog or I could add a not-so-fancy textfile to the blog repository in my GitHub account... My decision is to use the textfile version even if it hurts a bit, but my experience tells me to spend my time on Javascript, React and Redux instead.

I think it's a bit frustrating not to have a WYSIWYG tool for writing md-files. But I found one that I think works pretty well. I case you haven't tried, here it is: <a href="http://dillinger.io/">http://dillinger.io</a>
