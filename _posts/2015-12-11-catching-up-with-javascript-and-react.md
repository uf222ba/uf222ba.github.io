To get started with JavaScript and React in an efficient way i used my Black Friday-shopping bargain again. Code School and Google are my friends.
Until now I have finished three JavaScript (JavaScript Road Trip Part 1-3) at Code School. <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/ac70b59de56ae52cb8f7027c2082b940/">Have a look att my nice badges here</a>.
I like the courses, it's a god briefing of the essence of JavaScript with video lessons and exercises on every subject. My overall impression of their courses are excellent.

I have two JavaScript courses left to do, and I will take them as soon as possible. It's ES2015: The Shape of JavaScript To Come and JavaScript Best Practices.

I also found an offer for a course named "Build Web Apps with React JS and Flux" from Udemy. I think it's a good help, but it isn't anything near the Code School courses regardning the quality.
