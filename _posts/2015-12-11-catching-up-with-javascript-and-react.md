To get started with JavaScript and React in an efficient way i used my Black Friday-shopping bargain again. Code School and Google are my friends.
Until now I have finished three JavaScript (JavaScript Road Trip Part 1-3) at Code School. <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/ac70b59de56ae52cb8f7027c2082b940/">Have a look att my nice badges here</a>.
I like the courses, it's a god briefing of the essence of JavaScript with video lessons and exercises on every subject. My overall impression of their courses are excellent.

I have two JavaScript courses left to do, and I will take them as soon as possible.

* ES2015: The Shape of JavaScript To Come 
* JavaScript Best Practices.

I also found an offer for a course named <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-and-understand-reactjs/">"Build Web Apps with React JS and Flux" from Udemy</a>. I think it's a good help, but it's totally different from Code Schools courses. It's a video lessons course with a code repository on Github. The instructor, Stephen Grider, explains thoroughly how to build web apps with React in a very nice, pedagogically way.

Then I found <a href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead.io</a>. Many of my coursemates also have made aqauintance with the <a href="https://egghead.io/technologies/js">Redux video tutorial by Dan Abramov</a>. The tutorial is a great help and Dan is impressing.
