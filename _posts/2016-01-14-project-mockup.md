This is my project mockup. I've done it with <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq web app trial</a>. Balsamiq is a nice, easy to use tool for making mockups.

### About the application
The app is meant to be used by people breeding dogs. Giving dogs pedigree names is fun and many breeders like to give the puppies a bit extraordinary names. The Swedish Kennel Club database only allows 35 characters (kennel name included). So the idea behind this app is that you could add litters and play around with pedigree name suggestions without having to use pen and paper and manually count the letters. 

#### 1. The Kennel name
The Kennel name is meant to be a first time configuration. Usally you buy a kennel name and then you keep it for the rest of your life.

#### 2. Add litter
Step 2 is to add a litter. The litter will be added to the list below the textbox. It should be possible to delete a litter from the list. Click on a litter in the list to choose which one to work with name suggestions for.

#### 3. Name suggestions
In the name area to the right it should be possible to add and delete name suggestions to the list below it. Meanwhile working with the names, the user can see how many characters is used and how many still remaining to use.
