There is a page in the React documentation with the title <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html">"Thinking in React"</a>. The page serves as a good guide in the steps of building a React application. 

### The headlines in the page is as follows (and my todo list):

#### Start with a mock <img src="../images/small_tick.png" alt="Done">
<a href="http://uf222ba.github.io/react/redux/project/app/project-mockup/">My previous post where I presented my mockup for the Dogname App</a>
 
#### Step 1: break the UI into a component hierarchy <img src="../images/small_tick.png" alt="Done">
<a href="http://uf222ba.github.io/react/redux/project/app/break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy/">The post about breaking down the UI into components</a>.

#### Step 2: Build a static version in React
Work in progress.

#### Step 3: Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state


#### Step 4: Identify where your state should live


#### Step 5: Add inverse data flow

This list will be updated as the work progresses.  

### Version control
I've created a new branch named <a href="https://github.com/uf222ba/2DV607/tree/develop/DognameApp">develop for my new version of the Dogname app</a>.
