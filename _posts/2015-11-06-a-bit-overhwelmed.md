After going through all the material on React, React Router and Redux I feel a bit overhwelmed. It feels like I got answer to many of my thoughts and questions. And I realised my questions weren't silly after all.
Ahead there is large piece of work to do, get into using all the stuff. As usually I it's going to challenging from the beginning and then hopefully the flow will come along as soon as the pieces have fallen into place. I'm looking forward getting to know the possibilities and limitations of the framework and tools.
