I just need to tell you how smooth the installation went. I'm amazed that everything just got installed without a error message or that I afterwards needed to change some weird line in a config file to get it up and working. No quirks! Yiahaa!

I installed:

* Node v5.0.0 Stable Windows (x64)
* WebStorm

Then I downloaded the Demo App and it worked like a charm.
