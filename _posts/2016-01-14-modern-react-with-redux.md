Since I liked Stephen Griders video course "Build Web Apps with React JS and Flux" I immediately bought his new course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/">"Modern React with Redux"</a> when I got an offer. This course is really, really good in explaining Redux. It tells how to implement Redux when building an application. Stephen explains in a very clear and instructive way and he iterates the difficulties.
The course contains 7.5 hours of video lessons that is divided into lessons between 2.5 minutes to 13 minutes long. It's easy to go back and repeat things later if you need to.
The course material is available at GitHub. 

If you're intrested of a Udemy course, there are coupons and promo codes available on the web so a bit of googling is recommended.
